Project Abstract – AD340

Ian Peters – Chunda Zeng – Baldwin Browne 

Our group intends to create a note-taking app for our first project. This will be a simple scrolling 

list, with notes in descending order of entry (with the newest note at the top). At the bottom of the app, 

a text entry area will exist where new notes may be entered. Any note should be able to be edited or 

deleted; ideally, we’d like this done by pressing down anywhere on a specific note for a number of 

seconds to bring up an edit/delete option. If this long-push proves unworkable this early in the class, 

we’ll have buttons to press that would do the same thing. If the local date/time is easy to access, we 

may give notes the ability expire on a certain date, or pop up an alert.
